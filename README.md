# Basic-C-Program
The first C file marks my introduction to the C Language. It uses control statements, loops and functions to find factorials, calculate area and circumference, convert days into years, months and days, make a star pyramid pattern, or add two matrices, all on the user's preference.
I've made a basic project revolving arrays in the second file. It reads arrays, writes arrays, sorts in ascending and descending, finds the smallest number and finds the index of a particular number, in an array.
